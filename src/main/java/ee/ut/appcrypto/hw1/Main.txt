/*
 * Homework #1 tasks -- read this comment carefully.
 * 
 * Homework topics: hashing, symmetric encryption, public key cryptography.
 * 
 * Here you have a code templates that you will need to modify to complete the task.
 * 
 * Main class has some methods that call other classes and methods to perform basic
 * cryptographic operations.
 * 
 * You will have to implement
 *   - several hashing methods in MyDigest class,
 *   - several key generation methods in MyKeyGenerator class,
 *   - several signing methods in MySigner class and
 *   - several encryption/decryption methods in MyEncryptor class.
 * 
 * You will also need to modify Main class a bit. You can import any classes needed.
 * 
 * Read the existing code, especially the comments. Somewhere there are useful hints explaining
 * what exactly should you do.
 * 
 * Feel free to comment out sections that are not ready yet. Do one task at a time to achieve
 * the best results. Also feel free to add you own comments to the code, as many as you like.
 * 
 * You should resolve all the issues marked with 'FIXME'. Each one gives you some points. Once
 * resolved, feel free to remove 'FIXME' comments.
 * 
 * If you cannot complete some of the sections, just comment them out. You will still receive
 * points for remaining part of the task you'll complete.
 * 
 * You are allowed to use BouncyCastle provider library, get the latest version from
 * http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html -- you will need bcprov-jdk16-146.jar or
 * similar depending on your JVM version. Also make sure to add it to your project, example for
 * Eclipse: Project > Build Path > Configure Build Path > Libraries > Add JARs...
 * 
 * You are also allowed to use Apache Commons libraries if you feel need for that, however,
 * I recommend you do not use them here.
 * 
 * Except BC provider and Apache Commons, no other external library is allowed.
 * 
 * All together, you can get 20 points for this task.
 * 
 * Tasks in this file will give you 4 points.
